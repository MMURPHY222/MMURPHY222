### Hello 	:flying_disc:

I am a full stack developer with a background in sustainability and education. I graduated with a degree in Anthropology and Human Biology from Emory University in 2020. While at Emory I played varsity softball and club ultimate frisbee while balancing a rigorous academic load. I am looking to apply the skills I learned there to a career as a full stack developer. I will be a strong addition to any team and will contiue to gain knowledge each day in order to reach my goal.
